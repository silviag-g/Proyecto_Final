# Proyecto_Final

OBJECTIVES:
Get a submission file with the prediction of forecasting sales for Wallmart. This submission file would be save in as a csv (in our folder).

ENV:
Python 
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
Spicy


CODE: 
Download the data from Kaggle, there were 4 different files to download (feature, stores, train and test).
After having the data, we start cleaning and transforming this data in order to work with the most relevant data.
Once the data has been cleaned, it's was time to understand which variables did have an impact on sales. In order, to do this, we tested some statistics knowledge on this data (correlation, distribution, bloxpot).
With the most important variables defined, we started working on functions. It was really important to get a funcion which worked in order to proceed with Machine Learning.
Furthermore, the funcion used is based on WMAE. Also RandomForestRegression was used.
With all our functions defined, we conducted the train model and test.
Once this all was done, we had our submission file.
